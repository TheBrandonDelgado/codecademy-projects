# Saucy Tango Food Order Form
In this practice project, you will create a food order form for a restaurant.

The local mom-and-pop shop, Saucy Tango, has received a lot of love from the community recently. To keep up with demand, they’ve decided to open their restaurant for online orders. They’ve entrusted this task to you, a budding React developer.

Your goal is to create a functional form that allows customers to place their orders easily. Once the customer submits the form, the form will alert them about their order details. You will be provided with a menu and your task is to create a form that can take in customer details such as name, phone number, address, and order.
