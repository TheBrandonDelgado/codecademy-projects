# Quote Keeper
In this project, you will write a feature test for the development of a web application that allows users to save and display a collection of their favorite quotes. We will call this app “Quote Keeper”.

Quote Keeper should allow users to enter the following information about each quote they would like to save to the app:
* The quote itself
* Who the quote is attributed to
* The source of the quote:
* * Book
* * Article
* * Speech
* * IRL
